# Background

## Sports Betting Market Structure and Efficiency

The modern sports betting landscape has evolved dramatically with the legalization of online wagering across multiple jurisdictions, creating increasingly sophisticated and competitive markets. Academic research on sports betting market efficiency has produced mixed conclusions, with studies finding varying degrees of informational efficiency depending on sport, market type, and temporal factors [@Hubacek2019]. While primary markets for game outcomes tend toward efficiency through large betting volumes and professional analysis, secondary markets for player propositions often exhibit greater pricing disparities due to lower liquidity and reduced analytical attention.

Market efficiency research has consistently identified persistent inefficiencies in proposition betting markets, particularly for individual player statistics where information processing may be less sophisticated than for primary game outcomes. These inefficiencies create potential opportunities for systematic approaches that can process large volumes of player performance data to identify mispriced betting opportunities.

The house edge inherent in sportsbook pricing represents the fundamental challenge for profitable betting strategies. Standard odds structures ensure that sportsbooks maintain mathematical advantages even in efficiently priced markets, requiring bettors to achieve win rates substantially above 50% to generate positive returns. This edge varies across bet types and operators, with player propositions often carrying higher margins than primary game markets.

## Predictive Modeling in Baseball Analytics

Baseball analytics has undergone revolutionary advancement since the introduction of sabermetrics, with modern machine learning applications achieving increasingly sophisticated prediction capabilities. [@Huang2021] demonstrated that statistical models could achieve over 94% accuracy in MLB game outcome prediction using advanced feature selection techniques, while [@Li2022] developed comprehensive frameworks for identifying the most predictive baseball statistics for outcome prediction.

However, prediction accuracy and betting profitability represent fundamentally different optimization targets. [@Walsh2024] provided critical insights demonstrating that model calibration matters more than raw accuracy for betting applications, with calibration-optimized models achieving +34.69% ROI compared to -35.17% for accuracy-focused approaches. This finding has profound implications for sports betting model development, suggesting that traditional machine learning evaluation metrics may be counterproductive for betting applications.

Recent research has increasingly focused on ensemble methods for sports prediction, with [@Galekwa2024] finding that combining multiple algorithms consistently outperforms single-model approaches across various sports betting contexts. This research supports the development of comprehensive modeling frameworks that leverage multiple analytical techniques rather than relying on individual algorithms.

## Strategic Approaches to Sports Betting

Sports betting strategy research has traditionally distinguished between bottom-up and top-down methodologies, each with distinct advantages and limitations. Bottom-up strategies build predictions from fundamental performance analysis, requiring sophisticated statistical modeling and comprehensive data infrastructure to develop probabilistic assessments that can outperform market consensus. While exceptionally challenging to implement successfully, these approaches offer the potential to identify systematic market inefficiencies that persist over extended periods.

Top-down strategies focus on market-based analysis, examining line movements, betting volumes, and cross-market price discrepancies to identify temporary value opportunities. These approaches are generally more accessible to implement but face significant scalability limitations as successful practitioners often find themselves restricted or banned by sportsbooks that view systematic market exploitation as detrimental to their profitability models.

Research has documented the effectiveness of both approaches under specific conditions, but has largely failed to examine their potential integration. [@Hubacek2019] achieved systematic profitability by explicitly reducing correlation with bookmaker predictions while maintaining predictive accuracy, suggesting that the most effective approaches may involve developing independent probabilistic assessments that deliberately diverge from market consensus.

## Research Gaps and Methodological Innovation

Existing literature reveals a significant gap in systematic examination of hybrid approaches that combine bottom-up predictive modeling with top-down market analysis. While practitioners may informally blend these strategies, academic research has not rigorously evaluated whether such integration provides superior risk-adjusted returns compared to either methodology employed independently.

This gap is particularly notable given the complementary nature of these approaches: bottom-up modeling excels at identifying systematic performance patterns that may be undervalued by markets, while top-down analysis can identify optimal timing and execution strategies for capitalizing on identified opportunities. The combination potentially addresses the primary weaknesses of each individual approach while amplifying their respective strengths.

Furthermore, much of the existing research focuses on prediction accuracy rather than practical betting implementation, often overlooking critical factors such as bankroll management, market access limitations, and the sustainability of identified edges as markets adapt to systematic exploitation. These practical considerations are essential for translating theoretical modeling success into real-world profitability.

## MLB as an Analytical Environment

Baseball presents unique advantages for systematic betting analysis due to its extensive statistical history and the granular nature of recorded performance data. The sport's discrete, measurable events enable precise statistical modeling, while the introduction of Statcast technology has created unprecedented opportunities for advanced analytical approaches incorporating biomechanical measurements and contact quality metrics.

The individual nature of many baseball events—particularly batter versus pitcher confrontations—creates natural opportunities for player-specific proposition betting that may be less efficiently priced than aggregate team outcomes. Player proposition bets focus on individual statistical achievements rather than team outcomes, offering wagers on specific measurable events during a game.

Two of the most common player propositions involve hits and total bases. A hit occurs when a batter successfully reaches base via single, double, triple, or home run. Sportsbooks typically offer over/under markets on whether a player will record more than 0.5 hits (at least one hit) or 1.5 hits (multiple hits) in a game. Total bases represent the cumulative value of a player's hits: singles count as one base, doubles as two, triples as three, and home runs as four. A player hitting a double and a single would accumulate three total bases, while two singles would total two bases. Common total bases markets include over/under 1.5 or 2.5 bases.

These individual performance markets offer several analytical advantages over team-based betting. Player propositions depend primarily on individual skill and recent form rather than complex team dynamics, creating more predictable statistical patterns. The large number of games played throughout the baseball season provides substantial sample sizes for statistical analysis while creating numerous daily betting opportunities across multiple markets and operators.

Recent industry research has identified significant variation in sportsbook accuracy across different types of baseball bets, with player propositions showing greater pricing disparities between operators compared to primary game markets. This market fragmentation creates potential opportunities for systematic line shopping and value identification across multiple betting platforms.

## Research Objective and Contribution

Our investigation seeks to address the identified research gap by developing and evaluating a comprehensive hybrid framework that systematically integrates bottom-up machine learning prediction with top-down market analysis for MLB player proposition betting. The bottom-up component employs calibrated ensemble models trained on comprehensive Statcast and performance data to generate probabilistic assessments of individual player outcomes. The top-down component analyzes pricing patterns and market inefficiencies to identify optimal value opportunities and execution strategies.

This methodological integration represents a novel contribution to sports betting literature, treating predictive modeling and market analysis as complementary information sources within a unified expected value maximization framework. By systematically combining fundamental performance analysis with market intelligence, we aim to determine whether hybrid approaches can achieve superior risk-adjusted returns while addressing the practical implementation challenges that often limit the real-world applicability of theoretical betting strategies.

The investigation employs rigorous statistical validation methodologies and addresses sustainability concerns often overlooked in academic literature, providing insights into both the theoretical potential and practical limitations of systematic sports betting approaches in contemporary market environments.

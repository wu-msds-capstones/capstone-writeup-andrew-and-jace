# Introduction

The pursuit of financial independence increasingly drives individuals toward alternative investment strategies beyond traditional asset classes. While dividend-paying stocks and real estate provide established pathways to passive income, sports betting has emerged as a high-variance alternative offering potentially superior short-term returns at the cost of significantly elevated risk. This risk-return profile positions sports betting as fundamentally different from conventional investments: where traditional markets may deliver consistent but modest returns over extended periods, betting markets offer the possibility of rapid wealth accumulation alongside the substantial probability of total loss.

Major League Baseball presents a particularly compelling environment for systematic betting approaches due to its unique combination of data richness and market complexity. The sport generates unprecedented volumes of granular performance data through MLB's Statcast system, capturing everything from pitch velocity and spin rates to exit velocities and launch angles for every ball put in play. Simultaneously, the proliferation of online sportsbooks has created fragmented markets where dozens of operators independently price hundreds of daily player proposition bets, potentially creating systematic pricing inefficiencies.

Despite this data abundance, most sports bettors continue to rely on intuition and subjective analysis, consistently failing to overcome the mathematical edge built into sportsbook pricing structures. Even in evenly matched contests, standard odds of -110 require winning 52.4% of bets merely to break even, creating a substantial hurdle that eliminates the vast majority of recreational bettors over time. This persistent failure rate suggests significant opportunities for systematic, data-driven approaches that can identify and exploit market inefficiencies.

The challenge lies in developing methodologies that can consistently outperform market consensus while remaining scalable and sustainable over time. Traditional approaches generally fall into two distinct categories: bottom-up strategies that build predictions from fundamental performance analysis, and top-down strategies that derive insights from market pricing patterns and inefficiencies. However, academic literature has largely treated these as competing methodologies rather than exploring their potential integration.

Our investigation addresses this gap by developing and evaluating a hybrid analytical framework that systematically combines bottom-up machine learning prediction with top-down market analysis for MLB player proposition betting. This approach leverages both the pattern recognition capabilities of statistical modeling and the market intelligence derived from pricing analysis to identify systematic value opportunities across multiple analytical dimensions.

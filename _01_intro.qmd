# Introduction

One of the cornerstones of financial freedom is the ability to generate passive income-- making your money work for you. While few people aspire to work forever, the most successful individuals find ways to grow their wealth by leveraging existing capital. Common passive income strategies include investing in dividend-paying stocks and ETFs, as well as acquiring income-generating properties that provide steady cash flow with minimal ongoing effort. However, a less traditional but increasingly popular avenue for generating returns is sports betting. While neither the stock market nor real estate can guarantee profits, they are generally considered safer and more reliable over the long term. In contrast, sports betting offers the potential for faster and higher returns—albeit with significantly greater risk. This contrast highlights the trade-offs between conventional investment vehicles and high-variance alternatives like betting markets. This sets the stage for evaluating whether betting on Major League Baseball can be treated as a viable, data-driven income stream. 

Baseball has been played for over a century and is a team sport between two sides, each with nine players on the field at a time. The objective is to score runs by hitting a pitched ball and running around four bases—first, second, third, and home—in order. One team is on offense (batting), attempting to score, while the other plays defense (pitching and fielding), aiming to prevent runs by recording three outs. Once three outs are made, the teams switch roles. This exchange continues over nine innings, which make up a standard game. While the rules may seem simple, baseball is full of strategy and data-driven decision-making, especially with contemporary, advanced technology. Teams constantly analyze player matchups, pitching tendencies, and situational probabilities to gain an edge, which is exactly what makes the sport so appealing for sports betting as well.

With the rise of advanced statistics and real-time data, bettors now have a wide range of wagering options. These include moneylines (who wins the game), over/unders (total runs scored), and player props like total bases, which track how many bases a player earns through hits in a given game. Despite the availablity of data, many sports bettors rely on gut and intuition but it has proved to be a losing strategy for most. Compounding this challenge is the fact that sportsbooks maintain a built-in edge through the way odds are structured. For example, even in an evenly matched game, both teams might be listed at -110 odds instead of +100. This means a $100 winning bet would return just $90.90 in profit, rather than $100, creating a margin that favors the house. Thus, users have to win more than 52.4% of their bets to just break even [@AllThePicksEdge2023].

In this context, leveraging the vast amount of granular baseball data becomes crucial. With its rich statistical history and highly measurable in-game actions, baseball is one of the most analytically robust sports. It offers bettors an opportunity to apply data-driven strategies and models to gain an edge over the market.

# Conclusions

## Key Findings

### Over/Under Runs Bets
- **Bullpen performance is a key driver of scoring**: Relief pitcher stats, particularly ERA and innings pitched, were strong predictors of team run totals, often more so than starter metrics. This is intuitive: when a starting pitcher struggles, they're removed early, forcing greater reliance on the bullpen. This creates opportunities to exploit bullpen fatigue or depth mismatches. In future work, incorporating contextual bullpen data—such as relievers' recent usage or rest days—could enhance predictive power.

- **Expected stats signal potential shifts**: Gaps between actual and expected batting average (xBA) can correspond with changes in team scoring, indicating both positive and negative regression toward underlying performance levels.


### Prop Bets
- **Still finalizing preview history and run value metrics. For now, here’s how the scoring works**:

- Getting a Hit (H ≥ 1): +40
This assumes a payout ratio where a successful bet returns 4x your original stake.

- Getting 2+ Total Bases (TB < 2): –170
This reflects the steep odds, where missing the mark would cost you 17x your bet.
 We still need to do some tweaking and modifying for this.


- **Individual player prop prediction achieves solid academic performance**: Our machine learning models for individual player props achieved 0.549 AUC, closely aligning with the established academic baseline of 0.552 AUC (Elfrink, 2018). This performance demonstrates that meaningful signal exists in player statistics even within efficient prop betting markets, providing a foundation for future model enhancement.

- **Methodological rigor enables reliable results**: Through strict validation procedures and elimination of data leakage, our models achieved realistic performance expectations rather than artificially inflated metrics. The absence of same-game features in our importance rankings confirms successful prevention of information leakage while maintaining predictive capability.

- **Seasonal statistics provide core predictive foundation**: Feature importance analysis revealed that established seasonal performance metrics (batting average, OPS, wOBA) dominate individual player prediction, validating that player ability rather than game-specific circumstances drives prop betting outcomes. Historical per-game rates prove valuable for normalizing performance across different playing contexts.


## Implications

Our research demonstrates that analytical approaches to MLB betting market analysis can identify potential value opportunities across both team-level and individual player markets. The combination of team scoring models, individual prop prediction, and interactive matchup analysis creates a comprehensive framework for market evaluation that addresses multiple betting contexts within professional baseball.

The hybrid methodology successfully bridges traditional statistical analysis with modern machine learning techniques while maintaining academic rigor through proper validation and data leakage prevention. This approach provides a replicable framework for sports betting research that prioritizes methodological soundness over inflated performance claims, contributing to more reliable research standards in this emerging field.

The solid performance achieved by our models—clustering around established academic baselines—validates market efficiency research suggesting that sustainable edges in professional sports betting are necessarily modest. Rather than claiming exceptional results, our work establishes realistic expectations for legitimate MLB prediction models and provides tools for comprehensive market analysis.

The planned integration of live odds data represents the critical next phase for translating statistical predictions into practical betting applications. By implementing odds shopping across multiple sportsbooks and comparing model probabilities with market prices, future work can test whether identified statistical edges translate to profitable outcomes in real betting scenarios.

## Future Directions
 Future work will focus on enhancing model performance through expanded data integration. Key opportunities include incorporating weather conditions, ballpark factors, lineup position effects, and pitcher-specific matchup data directly into machine learning models. Additionally, developing rolling performance indicators and recent form metrics could capture player momentum and health status more effectively than season-long averages alone. The integration of advanced Statcast metrics, while carefully avoiding data leakage, may provide additional signal for both team and individual player outcomes. Real-time model updating systems that adapt to changing player conditions throughout the season represent another promising avenue for improving prediction accuracy.


## Ethical Considerations

### Data Privacy and Sources

The data utilized in this research consists entirely of publicly available information from professional baseball games, including Statcast measurements, player performance statistics, and sportsbook pricing data from both regulated and offshore operators. No personally identifiable information beyond public player names and performance metrics was collected. All data represents factual, objective measures that are routinely published within the sports analytics community.

### Responsible Gambling Considerations

The primary ethical consideration in this research concerns its potential application to sports betting activities. Several critical limitations and risks must be emphasized:

**No Guaranteed Profits**: Even if theoretical positive expected value opportunities are identified, variance inherent in probabilistic outcomes means that substantial losses remain possible over both short and extended periods. Historical performance does not guarantee future results.

**Variance and Risk Management**: The high variance nature of sports betting means that even systematically profitable approaches can experience extended losing streaks that exceed many individuals' financial tolerance. Anyone considering application of these findings must thoroughly understand proper bankroll management principles and position sizing strategies.

**Problem Gambling Risks**: This research is intended solely for academic and educational purposes. We strongly advise that anyone considering wagering activities seek education on responsible gambling practices and never risk money they cannot afford to lose entirely.

**Market Evolution**: Betting markets continuously evolve as operators adjust to new information. Any identified inefficiencies may diminish as markets adapt, potentially rendering historical findings obsolete.

**Disclaimer**: This research is conducted for academic purposes only. Any application of these findings to actual betting activities is undertaken entirely at the user's own risk. The authors accept no responsibility for financial losses that may result from application of this research. Readers are strongly encouraged to thoroughly research proper bankroll management techniques and to seek professional guidance on responsible gambling practices before considering any wagering activities.

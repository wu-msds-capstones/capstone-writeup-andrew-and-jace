# Conclusions

## Key Findings

### Over/Under Runs Bets
- Bullpen performance is a key driver of scoring: Relief pitcher stats-- particularly ERA and innings pitched—emerged as strong predictors of team run totals, often more so than starter metrics. This makes intuitive sense: when a starting pitcher struggles, they’re pulled early, increasing reliance on the bullpen. This dynamic creates opportunities to exploit bullpen fatigue or depth mismatches. Future work could incorporate more contextual bullpen data—such as recent usage patterns or rest days—to improve predictive accuracy. For instance, a reliever who has pitched on back-to-back days is unlikely to appear a third time, potentially weakening late-game pitching and favoring higher scoring (the over). Conversely, a well-rested bullpen could suppress late runs and tilt outcomes toward the under.

- Expected stats signal potential shifts: Gaps between actual and expected batting average (xBA) can correspond with changes in team scoring, indicating both positive and negative regression toward underlying performance levels. 


### Prop Bets
- Still finalizing preview history and run value metrics. For now, here’s how the scoring works:

- Getting a Hit (H ≥ 1): +40
This assumes a payout ratio where a successful bet returns 4x your original stake.

- Getting 2+ Total Bases (TB < 2): –170
This reflects the steep odds, where missing the mark would cost you 17x your bet.
 We still need to do some tweaking and modifying for this.






## Ethical Considerations

### Data Privacy and Sources

The data utilized in this research consists entirely of publicly available information from professional baseball games, including Statcast measurements, player performance statistics, and sportsbook pricing data from both regulated and offshore operators. No personally identifiable information beyond public player names and performance metrics was collected. All data represents factual, objective measures that are routinely published within the sports analytics community.

### Responsible Gambling Considerations

The primary ethical consideration in this research concerns its potential application to sports betting activities. Several critical limitations and risks must be emphasized:

**No Guaranteed Profits**: Even if theoretical positive expected value opportunities are identified, variance inherent in probabilistic outcomes means that substantial losses remain possible over both short and extended periods. Historical performance does not guarantee future results.

**Variance and Risk Management**: The high variance nature of sports betting means that even systematically profitable approaches can experience extended losing streaks that exceed many individuals' financial tolerance. Anyone considering application of these findings must thoroughly understand proper bankroll management principles and position sizing strategies.

**Problem Gambling Risks**: This research is intended solely for academic and educational purposes. We strongly advise that anyone considering wagering activities seek education on responsible gambling practices and never risk money they cannot afford to lose entirely.

**Market Evolution**: Betting markets continuously evolve as operators adjust to new information. Any identified inefficiencies may diminish as markets adapt, potentially rendering historical findings obsolete.

**Disclaimer**: This research is conducted for academic purposes only. Any application of these findings to actual betting activities is undertaken entirely at the user's own risk. The authors accept no responsibility for financial losses that may result from application of this research. Readers are strongly encouraged to thoroughly research proper bankroll management techniques and to seek professional guidance on responsible gambling practices before considering any wagering activities.

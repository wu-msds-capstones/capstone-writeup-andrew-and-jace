This article explains how sportsbooks maintain a built-in edge by structuring odds to favor the them. It details how -110 odds require bettors to win more than 52.4\% of bets to break even, highlighting the impact of vig on long-term profitability.}

abstract = {The study developed a profitable sports betting system using three novel components: (1) explicitly reducing correlation with bookmaker predictions while maintaining accuracy, (2) using convolutional neural networks for player-level feature aggregation, and (3) applying modern portfolio theory for optimal bet distribution. The system achieved systematic positive returns on NBA data from 2006-2014.}

Using NBA data, found that selecting models based on calibration rather than accuracy led to dramatically better returns: +34.69\% ROI versus -35.17\% ROI. In the best case scenario, calibration-based selection achieved +36.93\% versus +5.56\% for accuracy-based selection.}

abstract = {Are simple trading strategies profitable? It is a question that has been on the minds of academics and practitioners for decades. In this paper, we review the longstanding literature on trading strategies in spread betting (also known as handicap betting), a popular sports betting microstructure. We review over 600 strategy implementations and find that market efficiency and systematic misperceptions are not mutually exclusive per se. Predictable glitches occur, but they are too small to be profitably exploited which is consistent with efficient markets.}

# Introduction

A core principle of financial independence is the ability to generate passive income-- leveraging existing capital to create returns with minimal ongoing effort. Traditional strategies include investing in dividend-paying stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), or income-generating real estate. While these approaches offer relatively stable long-term gains, some investors have begun exploring alternative, higher-risk opportunities such as sports betting. Though more volatile, betting markets can offer the potential for faster and higher returns, raising the question: can a data-driven approach to betting, particularly in Major League Baseball (MLB), serve as a viable income stream? **Disclaimer: Gambling carries the risk of addiction and financial harm, making it essential to know your limits and engage responsibly.

Baseball is a team sport played between two sides of nine players, where the goal is to score runs by hitting a pitched ball and advancing around four bases. Teams alternate between offense (batting) and defense (pitching and fielding), with each half-inning ending after three outs. A standard game consists of nine innings. While the rules are relatively simple, modern baseball is highly strategic and data-driven. Teams constantly analyze player matchups, pitching tendencies, and situational probabilities to gain an edge, which is exactly what makes the sport so appealing for sports betting as well.

With the rise of advanced statistics and real-time data, bettors now have a wide range of wagering options. These include moneylines (who wins the game), over/unders (total runs scored), and player props like total bases, which track how many bases a player earns through hits in a given game. Despite the availablity of data, many sports bettors rely on gut and intuition but it has proved to be a losing strategy for most [@Thompson1996]. Compounding this challenge is the fact that sportsbooks maintain a built-in edge through the way odds are structured. For example, even in an evenly matched game, both teams would be listed at -110 odds instead of +100. This means a $100 winning bet would return just $90.90 in profit, rather than $100, creating a margin that favors the sportsbook. Thus, users have to win more than 52.4% of their bets to just break even [@AllThePicksEdge2023].

In this context, leveraging the vast amount of granular baseball data becomes crucial. With its rich statistical history and highly measurable in-game actions, baseball is one of the most analytically robust sports. It offers bettors an opportunity to apply data-driven strategies and models to gain an edge over the market.

We aim to investigate whether recent player performance, historical trends, advanced metrics, and variations in sportsbook odds can be leveraged to identify profitable opportunities in Major League Baseball betting markets.

# Background

This background section examines the theoretical and practical foundations for data-driven sports betting research. We first explore how modern sports betting markets operate and where pricing inefficiencies might exist, particularly for individual player propositions. We then review the evolution of predictive modeling in baseball analytics and how machine learning approaches have been applied to sports betting. Finally, we identify key research gaps in integrating statistical modeling with market analysis, setting the stage for our hybrid methodology that combines bottom-up player performance prediction with top-down market opportunity identification.

## Sports Betting Market Structure and Efficiency

The legalization of online sports betting across multiple jurisdictions has created increasingly sophisticated and competitive markets. However, research on sports betting market efficiency shows mixed results—different sports and bet types demonstrate varying levels of pricing accuracy [@Hubacek2019].

Main game betting markets (like who wins the game) tend to be efficiently priced due to high betting volumes and extensive professional analysis. In contrast, individual player proposition bets often show greater pricing disparities. These player prop markets receive less analytical attention and have lower betting volumes, potentially creating opportunities for systematic data-driven approaches.

The fundamental challenge for any betting strategy remains the house edge built into sportsbook pricing. Standard odds structures ensure that sportsbooks maintain mathematical advantages even in competitive markets, requiring bettors to identify opportunities where their expected value exceeds the built-in profit margins. This edge varies across bet types and operators, with player propositions often carrying higher margins than main game markets.

## Predictive Modeling in Baseball Analytics

Baseball analytics has evolved dramatically since the introduction of sabermetrics, with modern machine learning applications achieving increasingly sophisticated prediction capabilities. [@Huang2021] demonstrated that statistical models could achieve over 94% accuracy in MLB game outcome prediction using advanced feature selection techniques, while [@Li2022] developed comprehensive frameworks for identifying the most predictive baseball statistics.

However, a critical insight from [@Walsh2024] revealed that prediction accuracy and betting profitability represent fundamentally different goals. Their research showed that models optimized for probability calibration achieved +34.69% ROI compared to -35.17% for accuracy-focused approaches. Calibration refers to how well a model's predicted probabilities match actual outcome frequencies—for example, events predicted with 30% probability should actually occur about 30% of the time. This is crucial for betting because accurate probability estimates are needed to identify when market odds offer value, regardless of whether the model correctly predicts the outcome. This finding suggests that traditional machine learning evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall may actually be counterproductive for betting applications.

Recent research has increasingly focused on ensemble methods for sports prediction, such as [@Galekwa2024] findings that combining multiple algorithms consistently outperforms single-model approaches. This supports developing comprehensive modeling frameworks that leverage multiple analytical techniques rather than relying on individual algorithms.

## Strategic Approaches to Sports Betting

Sports betting research traditionally distinguishes between two methodological approaches. Bottom-up strategies involve building statistical models to predict outcomes more accurately than sportsbooks do. These approaches use player performance data, matchup analysis, and advanced metrics to generate probability estimates that might reveal when market odds are mispriced.

Top-down strategies focus on comparing odds across different sportsbooks to identify pricing inefficiencies. Rather than predicting game outcomes, these approaches look for discrepancies in how different operators price the same events, capitalizing on situations where one book offers significantly better odds than others.

While both approaches have shown promise independently, existing literature has not rigorously examined whether combining bottom-up predictive modeling with top-down market analysis provides superior results compared to using either methodology alone.

## Research Gaps and Methodological Innovation

A significant gap exists in formal examination of hybrid approaches that integrate predictive modeling with market analysis. While practitioners may informally blend these strategies, academic research has not evaluated whether such integration provides superior risk-adjusted returns.

This gap is particularly notable given the complementary nature of these approaches, statistical modeling excels at identifying undervalued performance patterns, while market analysis can identify optimal timing and execution strategies. The combination potentially addresses the primary weaknesses of each individual approach.

Furthermore, much existing research focuses on prediction accuracy rather than practical implementation, often overlooking critical factors such as bankroll management or market access limitations. These practical considerations are essential for translating theoretical success into real-world profitability.

## MLB as an Analytical Environment

Baseball presents unique advantages for data-driven betting analysis due to its extensive statistical history and granular performance data. The sport's discrete, measurable events enable precise statistical modeling, while Statcast technology has created opportunities for advanced analytical approaches incorporating biomechanical measurements and contact quality metrics.

The individual nature of many baseball events—particularly batter versus pitcher matchups—creates natural opportunities for player proposition betting that may be less efficiently priced than team outcomes. Two of the most common player propositions involve hits and total bases. Hit markets typically offer over/under wagers on whether a player will record more than 0.5 hits (at least one hit) or 1.5 hits (multiple hits) in a game. Total bases represent the cumulative value of a player's hits: singles count as one base, doubles as two, triples as three, and home runs as four. Common total bases markets include over/under 1.5 or 2.5 bases.

These individual performance markets offer analytical advantages over team-based betting. Player propositions depend primarily on individual skill and recent form rather than complex team dynamics, creating more predictable statistical patterns. The large number of games throughout the baseball season provides substantial sample sizes for analysis while creating numerous daily opportunities for profitable betting.

Recent research has identified significant variation in sportsbook accuracy across different types of baseball bets, with player propositions showing greater pricing disparities between operators compared to primary game markets [@Vandenbruaene2022].

## Research Objective and Contribution

Our investigation addresses the identified research gap by developing and evaluating complementary approaches that demonstrate both top-down and bottom-up methodologies for MLB player proposition betting. The first approach develops interactive tools for situational matchup analysis, enabling detailed examination of pitcher-batter historical performance and contextual factors that may reveal betting opportunities on a case-by-case basis.

The second approach employs calibrated machine learning models trained on comprehensive player performance data to generate probabilistic assessments, which are then systematically compared against real sportsbook odds from multiple operators to identify value opportunities. This hybrid methodology focuses on analysis of individual player propositions across large volumes of daily betting markets.

This dual-methodology investigation provides novel contributions to sports betting literature by rigorously implementing both approaches and examining their respective strengths for different aspects of the sports betting challenge. The research advances understanding of line pricing variations in proposition betting and provides practical insights into where different data-driven approaches may be most effective.

## Ethical Considerations
 We next wanted to address potential ethical issues before we get further into our work. These ethical considerations are important because our analytical findings can influence real-world behavior and financial decisions; thus acknowledging limits and risks helps prevent harm and misuse. Stating our standards up front also strengthens the integrity and reproducibility of the research and ensures alignment with responsible gambling and legal frameworks.

### Data Privacy and Sources

The data utilized in this research consists entirely of publicly available information from professional baseball games, including Statcast measurements, player performance statistics, and sportsbook pricing data from both regulated and offshore operators. No personally identifiable information beyond public player names and performance metrics was collected. All data represents factual, objective measures that are routinely published within the sports analytics community.

### Responsible Gambling Considerations

The primary ethical consideration in this research concerns its potential application to sports betting activities. Several critical limitations and risks must be emphasized:

**No Guaranteed Profits**: Even when positive expected value opportunities are identified, variance inherent in probabilistic outcomes means that substantial losses remain possible over both short and extended periods. Historical performance does not guarantee future results.

**Variance and Risk Management**: The high variance of sports betting means that even systematically profitable approaches can experience extended losing streaks that individuals may not be able to endure. Anyone considering application of these findings must thoroughly understand proper bankroll management principles and position sizing (deciding how much money to bet on each wager) strategies. 

**Problem Gambling Risks**: Sports betting can lead to significant financial harm and may negatively affect mental health. We strongly advise anyone considering wagering to seek education on responsible gambling practices and never risk money they cannot afford to lose. Betting should be approached cautiously and within personal limits.

**Market Evolution**: Betting markets continuously evolve as operators adjust to new information. Any identified inefficiencies may diminish as markets adapt, potentially rendering historical findings obsolete.

**Disclaimer**: This research is conducted for academic purposes only. Any application of these findings to actual betting activities is undertaken entirely at the user's own risk. The authors accept no responsibility for financial losses that may result from application of this research. Readers are strongly encouraged to thoroughly research proper bankroll management techniques and to seek professional guidance on responsible gambling practices before placing any wagers.

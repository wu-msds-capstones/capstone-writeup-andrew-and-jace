# Introduction

Sports betting has grown rapidly in popularity, fueled by increased legalization, media coverage, and widespread access to online platforms. For many, it remains a form of entertainment, but could it be something more? With the right data and strategy, is it possible to consistently identify favorable opportunities and gain an edge over the market? Specifically, can a data-driven approach to betting, particularly in Major League Baseball (MLB), serve as a viable income stream?

Baseball is a team sport played between two sides of nine players, where the goal is to score runs by hitting a pitched ball and advancing around four bases. Teams alternate between offense (batting) and defense (pitching and fielding), with each half-inning ending after three outs. A standard game consists of nine innings. While the rules are relatively simple, modern baseball stands out as one of the most analytically advanced professional sports.  Its one-on-one matchups and slower pace of play make it easier to isolate and track a wide range of distinct metrics in real time. Teams routinely analyze batter-pitcher matchups, pitching tendencies, and situational probabilities to gain a competitive edge—making baseball particularly appealing for data-driven sports betting. 

With the rise of advanced statistics, particularly expected metrics, and real-time data, bettors now have a wide range of wagering options. These include moneylines (who wins the game), over/unders (total runs scored), and player proposition bets (prop bets), which are specific bettable outcomes related to an individual player’s performance in a game. These include things like hits, will a player get a hit in this game (yes or no), and total bases, which track how many bases a player earns through hits in a given game. Despite the abundance of vailablity of data, many sports bettors rely on their intuition and personal biases-- an approach that seldom results in sustained success. Compounding this challenge is the fact that sportsbooks maintain a built-in edge through the way odds are structured. For example, in an evenly matched game, both teams are typically listed at -110 odds rather than +100. This means a $100 winning bet would return just $90.90 in profit, rather than $100, creating a margin that favors the sportsbook. Thus, in this context users would have to win more than 52.4% of their bets to just break even [@AllThePicksEdge2023].

In this context, leveraging the vast amount of granular baseball data becomes crucial. With its rich statistical history and highly measurable in-game actions, baseball stands out as one of the most data-intensive and analytically advanced sports. It offers bettors an opportunity to apply data-driven strategies and models to gain an edge over the market.

We aim to investigate whether recent player performance, historical trends, advanced metrics, and variations in sportsbook odds can be leveraged to identify profitable opportunities in Major League Baseball betting markets.
